# API Endpoint Summary

This project exposes a small FastAPI surface intended for local demos and portfolio review.

## Public Endpoints

| `POST` | `/chat` | Main employee chat entrypoint for HR/IT questions and workflow creation | Optional `X-User` |
| `GET` | `/requests` | List workflow requests created by the current user | Optional `X-User` |

## Admin Endpoints

Admin routes accept either `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-Admin-Token: <token>`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `PUT` | `/admin/system-prompt` | Update the system prompt |
| `GET` | `/admin/documents` | List uploaded/readable documents |
| `GET` | `/admin/documents/{doc_name}` | Preview a document and highlight owner/effective date metadata |
| `POST` | `/admin/documents` | Upload a new `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` document |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/documents/{doc_name}` | Delete a document by relative path/name |

## Core Request Shapes

`POST /chat`

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How often are salaries paid?"}
  ],
  "top_k": 4,
  "min_similarity": 0.25
}
```

Typical response fields:

```json
{
  "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."},
  "intent": "work",
  "language": "en",
  "sources": [
    {
      "source": "Payroll_FAQ.md",
      "chunk_id": 0,
      "text": "...",
      "score": 0.87
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- `X-User` defaults to `anonymous` if not provided.
- `POST /chat` can return document-grounded answers, topic-selection guidance, small-talk responses, or workflow creation confirmations.
- Workflow creation currently supports PTO, sick leave, document requests, access requests, equipment issues, and onboarding blockers.
- Admin document changes do not silently mutate the index; the explicit rebuild endpoint keeps demo behavior predictable.
